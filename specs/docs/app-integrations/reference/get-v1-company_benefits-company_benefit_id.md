# Get a company benefit

Company benefits represent the benefits that a company is offering to employees. This ties together a particular supported benefit with the company-specific information for the offering of that benefit.

Note that company benefits can be deactivated only when no employees are enrolled.

When with_employee_benefits parameter with true value is passed, employee_benefits:read scope is required to return employee_benefits.

scope: `company_benefits:read`
